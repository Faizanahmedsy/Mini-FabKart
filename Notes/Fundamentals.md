Sure. Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It helps you keep track of the state of your application in a central location, called the store. Redux Toolkit is a set of utilities that make it easier to use Redux.

Here are some of the fundamentals of Redux with Redux Toolkit:

* **State:** The state of your application is the data that your application needs to keep track of in order to function. For example, the state of a todo list application might include a list of todos, the status of each todo, and the user's current filter settings.
* **Actions:** Actions are objects that represent changes to the state of your application. For example, an action might be used to add a new todo to the list, or to mark a todo as completed.
* **Reducers:** Reducers are functions that take the current state of your application and an action, and return the new state of your application. Reducers are responsible for updating the state of your application in response to actions.
* **Store:** The store is a central location where the state of your application is stored. The store is responsible for dispatching actions and calling reducers.

Redux Toolkit provides a number of utilities that make it easier to use Redux, such as:

* `createStore()`: This function creates a Redux store.
* `createAction()`: This function creates an action object.
* `createReducer()`: This function creates a reducer function.
* `combineReducers()`: This function combines multiple reducer functions into a single reducer function.
* `connect()`: This function connects a React component to the Redux store.

Here is a simple example of how to use Redux Toolkit:

```
import { createStore, createAction, createReducer } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
  todos: [],
};

const todoReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  {
    addTodo(state, action) {
      state.todos.push(action.payload);
    },
    toggleTodo(state, action) {
      state.todos.find((todo) => todo.id === action.payload).completed = !todo.completed;
    },
  },
);

const store = createStore(todoReducer);

const addTodo = createAction('ADD_TODO');
const toggleTodo = createAction('TOGGLE_TODO');

export default {
  store,
  addTodo,
  toggleTodo,
};
```

This code creates a Redux store, a reducer function, and two action creators. The reducer function is responsible for updating the state of the store in response to actions. The action creators are used to dispatch actions to the store. The `addTodo` action creator is used to add a new todo to the list, and the `toggleTodo` action creator is used to toggle the completed status of a todo.

The `store` object is exported from the file so that it can be used by other components in the application. The `addTodo` and `toggleTodo` action creators are also exported so that they can be used by other components in the application.
